The airplane is controlled by the Accelorometer on MKII, and the user can move the board to move the airplane in the x or y directions accordingly. When a game is going on, pressing S1 will launch the ball from the airplane, pressing S2 will change the corlor of the ball if it is not launched. Enemy square will be randomly generated at the top section of the LCD screen. When the ball hit a square, if the color of the ball matches the color of the square, the square will be destoried, the user get scored, and then the ball will be reset. If the color does not match, or the ball is travelling beyound the top edge of the LCD screen, the ball will be reset directly.
